# EECS 435 Final Project:Wetland Image Recognition

This repo is the final project of EECS_435 DL:FAA at Northwestern.

The whole project is implemeted and tested with Google Colab.

Contributer: Maorong Wang and Yuanzhe Jin

Due to NAIP dataset is too large for github to handle, you can access to dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rzYHHWeeFoArQtmOFaYIB29Gzpo4qUjO).

The easiest way to set this up:

1.  Upload jupyter notebook file and three .py file to your Google Colaboratory.
2.  Upload the dataset on your own Google Drive.  
    Your directory should appear like this in Google Drive:
    <pre>
    ../  
        /dataset  
          /Nonwetland.mat  
          /wetland.mat  
        /WetlandImageRecognition.ipynb  
        /LeNet5.py  
        /MyNet.py  
        /Dataloader.py  
    </pre>
3.
